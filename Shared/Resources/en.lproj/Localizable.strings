"AboutMeViewText" = "Hello ü§ó\n\nI'm Julian - the developer of PDF Archiver. I started this project in 2017 with the macOS App and put a lot of heart and soul into it. üôÑ\nFriends of mine and I üë®üèª‚Äçüíª have been looking for a way to digitally sort documents so that they can be easily retrieved. üïµüèª We didn't want to use a cloud service where our documents would disappear into any database. We wanted a concept where as much information as possible could be stored in the file name. üíæ This is how we defined the following naming scheme:\n\n2019-07-04--blue-pullover__clothing_invoice.pdf\n\nIt contains a date, a description and tags. Everything together forms the file name, which can be easily searched on various operating systems.\nTo make this sorting as easy as possible I brought PDF Archiver to the iPhone. Here documents can be scanned and then automatically analyzed. ü§Ø The intelligent text recognition takes place exclusively on your device, so no private information leaves your device! üîí\n\nPDF Archiver is intended as a tool for your personal document workflow. So if you saved some time archiving your documents, or if there was a moment when you were happy to have all your documents on your iPhone, feel free to write a short comment on the App Store. üñã\n\nMade with üíö and üôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è in Oldenburg, Germany.";
